# Ideas for how region locking will be done
### Mainly looking for ideas how to add a blocker between areas and how they would unlock
#### Would be cool if its something easy to implement, and feels grounded in the world
##### This is only `Ideas` for whoever makes the region lock
###### Discuss in the `AP Elden Ring` chat and ping `@lBedrockl` for ideas to be added here

# Regions

## Limgrave

### Limgrave > Weeping
* something on bridge of sacrifice?
* Move or remove spiritspring that can be used to skip bridge
##### Lore idea
* `Bridge of Sacrifice Gate Key`
```
Opens the gate at Limgrave's south, where the Weeping Peninsula lies.

The Bridge of Sacrifice is the first line of defense for Castle Morne, as arranged by its fearful castellan. And yet, no amount of external blockades can defend against a mutiny.
```

### Limgrave > Caelid
* just copy paste a fort wall and put a door at the burning wall
* disable dragon ruins chest trap, or add seal so the cave can be cleared
* move waygate spawn point at third church of marika into bestial sanctum

### Limgrave > Liurnia
* Add a gate to the [thin cliff](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1114277493311033494/1425009549756076169/image.png?ex=68e60710&is=68e4b590&hm=76e6b952101390bd417d2b2cda7ce71599adeffa33978c7fbff9bd1537e1ef1f&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1579&height=904) and a key for said gate

### Limgrave > Nokron
* Already requires radahn boss dead but wouldn't add a sphere
* getting to altus would unlock nokron technically which is dumb
* so add a door in limgrave pit with an item needed for a sphere, could be radahn themed item
* or have and item trigger the star fall event `Starscourge's Failure` 

### Limgrave > Siofra
* Key Item to open up `Siofra River Well`

Glistening blood has been siphoned into the nail of this finger. Its sickly pale skin feels nothing now, but the nail still aches with sweetest pain.
```

### Forbidden Lands > Consecrated Snowfield

* Change the imp statue in `Ordina` to require key item not stonesword key
##### Lore idea

Unalloyed Sword Key

Stone key shaped like a sword. Encircled by spider-thin strands of unalloyed gold.

Breaks the seal on the imp statue guarding the evergaol in the Liturgical Town, Ordina. The last step on the way to Miquella's Haligtree.

The Haligtree is for those in desperate need of an age of compassion - certainly not aspiring Lords of the old order.

##### Lore idea
* `Redmane Castle Gate Key`
```

Starscourge Radahn lived to fight, bearing no hopes and dreams beyond personal glory. A lion bred for battle, and the perfect weapon for gods to wield.
