er mod tools Smithbox, and Dark Script 3

Run python generate.py   need yaml in players
Or python launcher.py    so you can gen template options



Now I just need to label every single item :worry:


Need to make multiple item fillers like (smithing stone [1] x3, filler=True)

once all checks are done ALL npc / quests need to be checked if they are missable via killing them


for priority location option had how many checks each location adds and how many progression items there are



Ideas

gracesanity, graces are checks
option to turn off healing item randomization, start with
scadutree options, start with, not random, only within dlc, anywhere

"This dungeon is not on the path." or "This dungeon is on the path of the Elden Lord."
using ground messages or the small stones with text on them

dlc start / dlc only

Regional stonesword key ring (one key item per region unlocks all stonesword statues in that region)
Regional stonesword keys (like the first one but per region)

QOL option to unlock a Site of Grace in the region once that region is unlocked
might be to complex todo, since it would need logic so you don't get access to an area you cant get to yet
